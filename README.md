# Fruithunter
# Introduction
This game is developed as the main part of a course [Small Game Project](https://edu.bth.se/utbildning/utb_kurstillfalle.asp?lang=en&KtTermin=20181&KtAnmKod=T0000501&parentPtKod=PAACI15h) at [Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://bth.se/eng).
Each group has 10 weeks to produce a game using the [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) methology. The game engine must be created from scratch using either [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL) or [DirectX11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX)

# About
The game is about catching wild, living fruits with the help of a bow that shoots magic arrows in as short a time as possible. The player has to explore the world according to which fruits need to be caught. However, the areas and fruits are not always easy to access. There are obstacles such as animals blocking fruit areas and uneven terrain that require the player to utilize the avatar's ability to move. The player fills fruit bowl with caught fruit. A complete fruit bowl ends the round.

# Details
The player selects a level represented by a fruit bowl. The fruit bowl tells you which fruits need to be collected to cope with the level. The player spawns in part of the map while a timer starts. The task is to catch the fruit by shooting the bow on these fruits to enchant them to come to you.
The fruits are moving and challenging to meet. Each type of fruit can be found in its own area on the course. Some areas are protected by animals that you have to bribe with other types of fruits to gain access. Other areas require hope to reach. When the player has collected all the fruits required for the fruit bowl, the round is over and time determines one's performance.
